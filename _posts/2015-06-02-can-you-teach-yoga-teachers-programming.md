title: "Can You Teach Yoga Teachers Programming"

---

If yoga teachers can teach you yoga, then you can teach yoga teachers programming.  

I am not saying that programming or teaching programming is easy. I am saying that it is easier to type some cryptic messages on keyboard than to do a crow pose (for most of us at least).  Today we are _not_ going to learn any fundamental programming concepts, nor will we talk about HTML and CSS that make up web pages.  We will talk about this little programming gem called [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).  It is even easier than HTML sans ugly notations like <ul>(unordered list, but who would know that).  It can produce some pretty amazing results for your web pages with minimum effort.

First, let take a look at an example of what Markdown looks like in real life.

[A Markdown example for yoga retreat](http://www.foryogi.com/retreats/12-rock-your-asanas-yangshuo-style)

- In the menu section, you will see list of bullets with bolded fonts.
- In FAQ section, you will see hyperlinks to click on.

There are many examples of Markdown throughout ForYogi.  We have been helping teachers and resorts to present their information beautifully by applying Markdown to textual information.  Now we want to teach yoga teachers to do the same. You can test it out on ForYogi when you edit information for retreats, resorts, etc.  Let us know how you like it or if you have encountered any issues.  We are always here to help!

Now is the official start of the Markdown tutorial.

### List

The most often used format is list.  There are two types of list, numbered and un-numbered.

This is how to make a numbered list:

<pre>
I am a numbered list:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
</pre>

And it looks like this:

I am a numbered list:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

This is how to make an un-numbered list:

<pre>
I am a simple list:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
</pre>

And it looks like this:

I am a simple list:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

**Note**: There is an empty line between the list and the text above.

### Emphasis

You can create emphasis using asterisks or underscores.

<pre>
**this is emphasis** or _this_.
</pre>

Looks like this:

**this is emphasis** or _this_.

###Links

To create a link, use square bracket for the name of the link and parens for the url.

<pre>
[ForYogi](https://foryogi.com)
</pre>

This renders a link to ForYogi:

[ForYogi](https://foryogi.com)

###Images

Images are similar to links.  Start declaring an image with a bang, followed by square brack for the name of the image, and parens for the url of the image.  The image will need to be publicly accessible, for example, it could be an image from Google search.

<pre>
![How about no](http://foryogi.com/how-about-no-bear.jpg)
</pre>

This renders the image like this: 

![How about no](http://foryogi.com/how-about-no-bear.jpg)

There are many more formatting options such as headers, quotes, etc.  Check out the complete [reference](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)
