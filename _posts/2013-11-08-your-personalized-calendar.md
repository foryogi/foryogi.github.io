Your Class Planner is a simple list of suggested  classes from your favorite teachers. It displays a weekly view of classes that fit your yoga type with date, time, and studio. If you'd like to go to a class, click on the “Going”  button. This will add an entry to your workout log. Congratulations!  You’ve just increased your workout score by one! The 'Going' link will be changed  into 'Not going'. If you ever change your mind, simply click on it to remove the workout log entry. You can always click on the workout badge and view your entire history. Your Class Planner is updated weekly, so you get a fresh listing to start a new week.

Your Class Planner saves you time! Instead of searching studio schedules to find classes, Your Class Planner selects them for you. Discover new studios  -- and new experiences -- with your favorite teachers. You never know what you may discover. ForYogi does the work for you, helping you get more yoga into your day.
