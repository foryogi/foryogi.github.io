Have you seen the star-ratings in search results from search engines like Bing and Google?  Star-rating helps people to better understand the quality of service provided by business venues.  Popular websites such as Yelp have been surfacing star-rating in search results consistent with the information available on their websites.  ForYogi has also implemented this functionality and here is a screen capture of what Bing shows when a user searchs for "Melissa Capezzuto Yoga".

The 4th entry in the results on Bing is from ForYogi, right after Melissa's own website and Facebook Page.  The difference is that ForYogi's result also displays a star-rating, scale of the rating (5/5) and number of ratings (1).  The text below the rating comes from the text of an actual review.

The technology behind rating in search result is [schema.org](http://schema.org), sponsored by search giants like Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo.  ForYogi has implemented various schemas throughout the website including resorts, studios, teachers, etc.  This technology delivers rich and structured information (including thumbnail photos) into search results and helps our users to be better discovered.

Since we are talking about search results, I would like to briefly mention page ranking as well.  We have used various search engine optimization (SEO) techniques to help search engines to index and find our information better.  The bottom line is usage helps page ranking.  If more people visit your page, give you reviews and ratings, then you will get more attention from search engines.  There is only so much technologies can do without spending a ton on Google Adwords or Facebook Ads.
