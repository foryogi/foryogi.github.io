[Pinterest](http://pinterest.com) recently added [rich pins](http://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/) to better market business.  Rich pins contain more information about product offers including price and availability.  ForYogi has added the support of rich pins for [retreats](https://foryogi.com/retreats/new), [workshops](https://foryogi.com/workshops/new), and [teacher trainings](https://foryogi.com/teacher_trainings/new).  When someone pins a yoga retreat from ForYogi, more information about that retreat will be displayed to user than a 'regular' pin:

- **Price and currency**: user no longer needs to manually input this information.  They are always displayed on the product pin without having to mouse hover over product image.
- **Availability**: in or out of stock
- **Quantity**: spots available
- **Automatic update on price and availability**: user no longer has to manually update prices and availability on the pin.  Repins will preserve up-to-date information.

[Shopify](http://shopify.com)'s study shows that rich pins drive up product sales.

>To better understand how Pinterest is effecting the ecommerce industry, we analyzed data from over 25,000 Shopify online stores. Interestingly, referral traffic from Pinterest to Shopify stores is equal to traffic coming from Twitter. Of that traffic, shoppers are 10% more likely to make a purchase compared to those who arrive from other social sites. Furthermore, of those purchases, the average order is $80 which is double the average order from Facebook. Pinterest has already become a huge player in the world of ecommerce.

[MCNG Marketing](http://www.mcngmarketing.com/why-businesses-need-to-use-rich-pins-for-pinterest-immediately/) has a good blog on how rich pins better prevent fraud.

>The problem for businesses before was that when pins were taken off a site or repinned their descriptions could be changed, and tampered with. So people could purposely put the wrong price if they wanted to in the description and then go to the site, and realize that it was much more expensive. Now with rich pins, a user can trust that the price listed is most likely the right price.

You can now create retreats/workshops/teacher trainings on ForYogi and let the pinning begin!
