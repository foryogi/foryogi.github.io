Tweets with links to ForYogi retreats just got a whole lot prettier. By supporting Twitter Cards on ForYogi, any tweet containing a link to a yoga retreat will provide more context when viewed on Twitter.com. Here's an example:  

![Twitter Card]({{ site.url }}/assets/2013-10-04-twitter-card.png)

It displays a featured image of the retreat, which can be specified by the teacher.  It also displays retreat title, description, twitter user name of the teacher, and a link to the retreat.  

We will add Twitter card support to workshops, teacher trainings, and other parts of ForYogi soon.

Enjoy!
