![ForYogi Status Update]({{ site.url }}/assets/2013-11-01-status-update.png)

On October 30th, one of our data centers located in the east region of US had a disruption of service which inadvertently affected the part of the operation of ForYogi website.  While the engineers of our vendor worked hard on restoring the service, we notified our users on Twitter and with emails with site updates.  However, we would like to make our service availabilty more transparent and perform service updates in an automated fashion.

Today we are happy to announce a [status page](http://foryogi.statushub.io).  You can count on this page for the most up-to-date information about the general availability of our website as well as specific services disruptions, such as database.  This page is hosted outside of ForYogi to be independent of any future service disruption.  You can check this website for our service updates and signup to get email and SMS notifications.
