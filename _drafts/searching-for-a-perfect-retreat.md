### Resort

Selecting resort can be time consuming.  Yangshuo is a tourist town and has plenty options for stays.  Our selection criteria are the follows:

- On-site space for practicing yoga
- Access to kitchen since we have our own cook
- Western standard rooms


why did i select mountain retreat as the resort?

how did i select the activities?
