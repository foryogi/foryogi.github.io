    <h2>Meditation In Noise</h2>
<p class="meta">17 Sep 2013</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I met Daniel Li Ox of the <a href="http://wanderingdao.com/team/teachers/daniel-li-ox/">Wanderingdao</a> while visiting Yangshuo, China.  We had many interesting conversations along with vegan juice and vegetarian dishes that Xifuli makes.  This a story Daniel told me that I find myself keep sharing with others. </p>

<p>Daniel was participating a several-day long meditation course with a master.  On the first day, as soon as the meditation started, workers outside of the meditation room started cutting trees with electric chain saws.  As the work continues, treeing being cut down and fell to the ground,  people started leaving.  On the second day, the tree-cutting continued and more people left.  Same thing happened on the 3rd day.  Less and less people showed up each day but the master said nothing.  Some people had hoped that the master would tell the workers to stop so they can focus on the meditation.  On the 4th day, master suddenly opened his eyes and said - <em>do not disturb the noise</em>.</p>

<p>That is the moment of revelation.  </p>

<p>Noise is bad for meditation, we all know that.  Many of us live in an urban environment and itâ€™s essential to be able to meditate despite of city noise.  We think we have succeeded if we could ignore the noise.  But what the master said is not only noise is not bad, it has its own right to exist amongst us.  Instead of rejecting, ignoring the noise, we could treat it as part of necessity such as air.  By not reject it, we are in much better harmony.  And if you think about it, which disturbs you more, outer or inner noise?</p>
